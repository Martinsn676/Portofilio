    <h2>-Martin Skåla Nygård</h2>
    <span>I am very lazy and only do tasks when they have to be done or I can do them most effeciently, which is traits that have given me very good prioritizing and planning skills. 
        This is the excact thing you want in a web developer that easily can cost you hours of pay for small thing.</span>
    <span> have been having first hand experience with the time consuming work of working
        on a digital platform, and I am now learning myself web design and coding to be quicker at my job, and also cut out the very limited, time wasting and messy front end templates within 
        backend systems and instead making the front end myself.</span>
    <span>My current work tasks is as follows:</span>
    <ul>
        <li>Manage Shopify template</li>
        <li>Place orders</li>
        <li>Add products and price them</li>
        <li>Customer service</li>
        <li>Handling deliveries and customs</li>
    </ul>
